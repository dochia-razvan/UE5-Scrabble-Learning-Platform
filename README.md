#UE5-Scrabble-Learning-Platform

This project is a Scrabble-based learning platform designed to help users acquire knowledge about accessibility in digital content, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). The game combines the traditional Scrabble mechanics with educational content.

As the team leader, I guided the development of this educational game, which blends classic Scrabble with information about new technologies. It features a question-based system where players must fill in missing words using scrabble letter tiles.

This repository contains only the compiled .exe game file, which can be run on compatible systems. The project was developed using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and we used blueprints for gameplay and UI/UX design. The team worked on game mechanics, educational content creation, and ensuring the game runs smoothly and provides a good user experience.

A team project for the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest.
